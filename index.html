          <h2>Why I Love It</h2>
          <p>Smarties are more than just a candy to me. They remind me of my childhood and the simple joy of opening a tube of Smarties and pouring them out, ready to be devoured. The bright colors, the crunchy candy shell, and the creamy chocolate inside make them irresistible. Each Smartie is like a little burst of happiness in my mouth. Whether I'm enjoying them on their own or using them to decorate a cake or cookies, Smarties always bring a smile to my face. They are a treat that I will never outgrow, and I'm proud to say that I still eat the red ones last!</p>

    <div class="content-wrapper">
      <div class="content-left">
        <p>Once upon a time, in a small candy factory in Canada, the first Smarties were created. It was the year 1937, and the company responsible for this delightful treat was Rowntree's. These colorful candies quickly became a hit, captivating the taste buds of people of all ages.</p>
        <p>The original Smarties were larger than the ones we know today, and they came in different flavors. However, as time went on, the candy evolved, and the assortment of flavors was replaced with the iconic chocolate filling.</p>

            Smarties Candy Company is a sweet family business. On January 10, 1949, Edward Dee brought his family from England to New Jersey. Equipped with only two machines in a rented facility, he succeeded in founding Ce De Candy, Inc., makers of Smarties®, America’s favorite candy wafer roll. The company is now led by the founder’s granddaughters, Co-Presidents Sarah Dee, Jessica Dee Sawyer, and Liz Dee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Edward opened his first factory in Bloomfield, New Jersey, in August 1949. He proceeded to move the company to Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1959 and finally to Union, New Jersey, in 1967. On January 1, 2011, the company changed its name from Ce De Candy, Inc. to Smarties Candy Company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Edward also created Ce De Candy, Ltd. in Canada, opening a factory on Queen Street in Toronto in 1963. Later, he moved the operation to a new Canadian facility built in Newmarket, Ontario, in 1988 to make more Smarties® and “Rockets®,” as they are called in Canada.
          </p>
          <p>
            October 2, 2022, Edward Dee’s birthday, marks the first National Smarties Day, a day to celebrate the sweet legacy of an iconic candy and its founder’s vision to inspire life-long learning. Utilize the day to savor the day. Just as each Smarties roll is a random assortment of flavors, making for a unique experience every time, there’s an endless number of ways to celebrate #NationalSmartiesDay! When in doubt, sit down and eat a roll... Or maybe two... the best choice might be to grab a whole bag and maybe some Smarties Mega Lollies while you’re at it!
          </p>
          <p>
            Smarties® are made 24 hours a day in two candy factories located in Union, New Jersey, and Newmarket, Ontario. The company produces billions of Smarties® rolls each year.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can find Smarties® in just about every retail store and vending machine across the United States and Canada.
